                I'm just here to convince you to watch anime. Anime is love, anime is life. 
                I don't know where I would be without it.
                There's so many genres to explore, just like in western media. 
                In my humble opinion, I suggest watching subbed anime over dubbed as 
                I believe subbed catches and conveys human emotion so much better than dubbed can.

                        This first character is Killua Zoldyck from an anime called Hunter x Hunter.
                        Hunter x Hunter is one of my favorite anime of all time, if not my favorite,
                        and Killua is probably one of my favorite characters from the show.

                        This second character is Zoro from an anime called One Piece. One Piece
                        is the longest running anime to my knowledge, with over 1000 episodes and it 
                        has been airing for over 20 years! And from day one, Zoro has been that guy.

                        He is probably one of my favorite overall anime characters of all time, 
                        due to how unhinged he can be, as well as his personality and character design.

                        Along with JJK, Demon Slayer is one of the more popular modern anime and 
                        Tengen is probably my favorite character from this one due to his personality.
